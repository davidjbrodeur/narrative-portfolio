                            <p>Immersive storyteller with many years in creative writing through various avenues. I made a seamless transition to video games some years ago in order to focus on designing and crafting worlds that strike the imagination. My main goal and focus is to create <i>situations</i> in which the player's <i>actions</i> creates the <i>story</i> in a deep and visceral way.</p>

                        <p>I have been a game master in various TTRPGs systems desining worlds for many years. I was also paid as a game master profesionnally for Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition and participated in conventions as a game master. During that time, I designed most of my adventures, worlds and stories; those that I did not design were greatly expanded, such as a soon-to-be-published expansion and recreation of Curse of Strahd from Wizard of the Coast. I also maintained a <a href="https://psionicblastfromthepast.blogspot.com/">blog</a> where I posted dungeon mastering tips and adventures weekly, where some hit thousands of views. One of my long-standing campaign was a 15+ players <a href="https://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/">West Marches</a> style campaign with an open world.</p>
